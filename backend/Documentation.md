# About uTrivia API

uTrivia API is a RESTful...

## Backend Setup

The Backend of uTrivia API is built with 🐍 Python 3.10 and Flask 2.2.2. To get started with the backend setup, we highly
recommend following the instructions below which help you set up a virtual python environment, however you're more than
welcome to use other environments you may already have on your system provided they meet the package requirements
included in the requirements.txt file.

To get started make sure you are in the backend directory by running this command 📁`cd backend` on the terminal from the
root of the Application

**Upgrade pip**

```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
```

**Install virtualenv**

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
```

**Create a virtual env**

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

**Activate a virtual env**

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

**Install packages**

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Set the App and Debug Parameters**

 ```bash
 export FLASK_APP=flaskr FLASK_DEBUG=True
 ```

**Run the App**

```bash
flask run
```

## Front End Setup

The frontend we've provided to help you get started is a ReactJS application, but feel free to code yourself another
application using frontend frameworks such as VueJS, Angular etc.

Navigate to frontend folder by typing 📁 `cd frontend`  from the root directory of the Application.

```bash
npm install && npm start
```
